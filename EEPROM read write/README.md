# Reading and writing the data in Arduino EEPROM

EEPROM stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory which is the permenant storage memory where one can store the data for long time even the Arduino is switched OFF. In order to access the data written in Arduino EEPROM , certain algorithm is needed. Here, the sketch perform such a algorithm. It can able to read as well as write the data in EEPROM. For that,the certain command is needed, for example read 3 reads the data from the address 3, read (address) is the syntax for reading the data. Similarly, write 5 67 writes 67 at the address of 5 , write (address) (data) is the syntax for writing operation. And, the sketch is developed for Arduino UNO.
